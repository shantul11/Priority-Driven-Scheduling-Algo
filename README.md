# Priority-Driven-Scheduling-Algo

Scheduling algorithms are methods used in operating systems to distribute resources among processes in a scheduled manner. 
The purpose of these algorithms is to minimize resource starvation by ensuring that each process gets its required CPU time.
The algorithm implemented here is a priority driven algorithm i.e., a process is assigned a priority , and the scheduler selects the process to run according to it . 
In this case, the priority is set according to the deadline of the processes , and  in case of having same deadlines, it selects processes based on their shortest execution time. 
The integration of two approaches makes it an efficient solution for real â€“ time environment.
